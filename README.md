# TCPShield for Fabric
This is a fork of the [TCPShield plugin](https://github.com/TCPShield/RealIP) for the same named DDoS mitigation service 
[TCPShield](https://tcpshield.com).

The plugin is responsible for validating clients join via the TCPShield network.
It also parses passed IP addresses so the server is aware of the real player IP address.

This mod aims to port the plugin to the Fabric loader to support Fabric servers.

### Compatibility

This mod is only compatible with Fabric and requires the Fabric API. 

For compatibility with CraftBukkit, Spigot, Paper, BungeeCord and Velocity,
visit the [original plugin](https://github.com/TCPShield/RealIP).
